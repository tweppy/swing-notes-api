Swing Notes is a backend app (in progress of becoming fullstack with react) that provides a secure platform for managing your notes. This application is built using a combination of technologies such as MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and JWT authentication. It offers user registration, login functionality, and enables users to create, edit, delete, and retrieve their notes securely with proper authentication.
